### Hi there 👋

My name is XiaoRui. I am from the School of Mathematical Sciences of Dalian University of Technology. I am currently a senior in undergraduate studies. My research direction is computer vision. I am familiar with multiple languages. I am particularly good at python and nodejs. I like to keep exploring new things.

_Recently, I developed a puzzle game, click on the link to experience it () => https://bobby.duters-wu.cn.
